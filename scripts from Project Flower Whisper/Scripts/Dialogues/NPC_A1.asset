  sentences:
  - Welcome, traveler. You may not know, but this fountain was once full of life,
    spouting not water, but sweet orange juice.
  - In those days, the fountain was surrounded by laughing travelers, the scent of
    orange juice filled the air, and everyone could find a moment of refreshment
    and vitality here.
  - I know there is a flower that can bring back that lost vitality. Its color is
    as bright as orange juice, and its language carries the vitality of life and
    a fearless spirit.
