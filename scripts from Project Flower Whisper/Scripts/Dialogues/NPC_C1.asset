  sentences:
  - "Oh, dear traveler, you\u2019ve come. I've been waiting, waiting for someone
    who can bring back the innocence and joy of childhood."
  - This amusement park was once filled with laughter and joy, those little hearts
    found boundless happiness here. But now, the laughter is fading, and I can feel
    the innocence slipping away.
  - The flowers I guard, they know many secrets, and they understand many emotions.
    But only a flower that symbolizes childhood innocence can reignite the joy in
    this place.
  - Can you find that flower? One that can make the children laugh and run carefree
    again. That kind of smile... I have never forgotten.
